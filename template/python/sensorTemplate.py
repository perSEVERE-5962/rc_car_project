# Make an empty file called __init__.py in the same directory as the sensor library file that you are creating
#     You could also copy the one from template/python folder
#
# That will signify to Python that it's "ok to import from this directory"
#
# Then, in your main program file you can import your class
#     For example, if your file is called hcsr04.py and the class is called Hcsr04
#     you would add the following to your main program file
#         from hcsr04 import Hcsr04
#


# import any of the required libraries for the sensor

# include the networktablesinstance
from networktables import NetworkTablesInstance

# create the class
# see https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/class for a tutorial


class SensorTemplate:
    "Put a description of your class here in quotes"

    # setup network tables
    ntinst = NetworkTablesInstance.getDefault()
    ntinst.startClient("put ip address of the server here")
    # change "sensor" to be the name of your sensor
    table = ntinst.getTable("sensor")
    # change the following to match the information you want to store for your sensor
    sensor_value = table.getEntry("sensor_value")
    sensor_value_2 = table.getEntry("sensor_value_2")
    # add as many entries as you need

    # create the constructor to initialize the class
    # you can specify as many parameters as needed, with or without defaults
    # see https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/function-argument for a tutorial
